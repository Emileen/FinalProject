#Connecting Communities:  A Refugee and Immigrant Resource Network
> This is a Demo Day final project built by Louise Clark (frontend) and Emileen Marianayagam (backend).

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
> > This web application supports refugees and immigrants beyond the 90-day official support infrastructure that is already established.  
> Beyond this 90 days, these populations need continued assistance in finding employment, connecting with existing programs offered by network members, and creating connections.  
> We want to foster their inclusion in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg region so that they wonâ€™t feel alienated or afraid.  
> This site also provides a centralized hub for all agencies and organizations dedicated to helping refugees and immigrants.

## PROJECT FEATURES
> #*# registration form that allows agencies and organizations to request to be added to the network.
> #*# dynamic map that displays various categories of agencies/organizations:  agencies, medical, schools, libraries.  
> #*# search bar feature that populates markers from our databse that is related to the search input.

## FUTURE PLANS
> We want to further develop the map feature - accordian controller feature perhaps to display all agencies? 
> Login for agency users
> Calendar feature for agency users to share meetings, events, fundraisers
> Social Interaction Feature:  place for refugees and immigrants themselves to discuss personal recommendations
